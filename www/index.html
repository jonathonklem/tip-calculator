			<h2>About</h2>

			<p>There are far too many crappy apps with interstitial and banner ads making a bad experience worse.  It's much more than just an annoyance it's a privacy concern.  A lot of free apps are gathering usage statistics about their users.  My goal is to provide crappy apps without ads that don't gather any data.</p>

			<p>If you enjoyed using this app, you may enjoy some of the other apps that I've written.  A list of them can be view <a href="http://jonathonklem.com/apps">by clicking here</a>.  While you're there, feel free to peruse my developer blog if you're in to that sort of thing.</p>

			<p>I also do web application development professionally.  If you're interested in working with me, you can visit my business contact page <a href="http://dayat.net/contact/">here</a>.</p>

			<p>Lastly, are you a freelancer or do you aspire to become one?  Check out my website <a href="http://www.teachmetofreelance.com/">TeachMeToFreelance.com</a>.  I write a lot on how to grow a freelancing business and how to deal with problems that freelancers face.  Additionally I've written an e-book on the subject which can be purchased by clicking the book thumbnail below:<br>

			<p>Even if you don't purchase the e-book if you use that or <a href="http://amzn.to/1UmtJzv">this</a> link before making a purchase on amazon a percentage of the commission will go towards continuing to support me cranking out crappy apps with no ads or data gathering!</p>
